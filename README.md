# Ubuntu Throttlestop

A simple tool and set of instructions to manage thermal behavior and disable the `bd-prochot` bit on Intel CPUs for Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) using MSR (Model-Specific Registers).

## üöÄ Features

- Disable the `bd-prochot` bit on Intel CPUs to prevent thermal throttling.
- Easy-to-follow steps for managing CPU performance.
- Compatible with most Intel CPUs on Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu).

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need the following:

- **MSR Tools**: For testing, reading, and writing Model Specific Registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install msr-tools
  ```

- **cpufrequtils**: To monitor CPU usage across all cores.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install cpufrequtils
  ```

## üìã Installation Steps
### 1. Enable MSR module
Load the `msr` module:
```bash
sudo modprobe msr
```

### 2. Read the MSR register `0x1FC` on all cores
To check the current value of register `0x1FC`:
```bash
sudo rdmsr -a -d 0x1FC
```
Example output:
```
262236
262236
262236
262236
```

### 3. Disable the `bd-prochot` bit
To disable the `bd-prochot` bit, subtract 1 from the value of `0x1FC`. Using the example above, subtract `1` from `262236`:
```bash
sudo wrmsr 0x1FC 262235
```

### 4. Verify CPU behavior
Check if your CPU speed is changing by running:
```bash
watch -n 1 cpufreq-info
```
